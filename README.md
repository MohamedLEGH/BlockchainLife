# BlockchainLife

Create a Bitcoin-based entity which can earn money, mutate, multiply, and dies. Very crude starting point which needs decades of further work in order to be considered 'really' living. This projects builds upon existing code creating crude Bitcoin Life.

You will create an Internet-deployed system which can earn money, replicate itself, and which has no human control. In the past humanity has created chess programs that it can no longer beat. The distant future of an omniscient computer system that on day chooses to exterminate humanity in the Terminator films is the not focus of your project. You will create software that is beyond human control and includes breathtaking features such as earning money (Bitcoin) and self-replicating code (software buys a server+spawn clone). Earning money consists of helping others become anonymous using the Tor-like protocols developed at TUDelft and our own cybercurrency designed for this purpose, called Trustchain coins. You Python software is able to accomplish some parts of the following functionality:

Earn income in a form of cybercurrency (existing code)
Sell this cybercurrency on a market for Bitcoins
Buy a server using Bitcoins fully automatically (see our PyPi scripts)
Login to this Linux server and install itself from the Github repository
The software also should be able to have a simplistic form of genetic evolution. Key parameters will be inherited to offspring and altered with a mutation probability. For instance, what software version of yourself to use (latest release?), what type of server to prefer buying (quad core, 4GB mem, etc), and if you offer Tor exit node services for income. Bitcoins owned by TUDelft will be used to bootstrap your research.

## About us
We are a team of five Master Computer Science students from TU Delft following the blockchain engineering course. For this course students create teams and are assigned a project that involve the blockchain technology. 

## Project updates
Updates and information of the project can be found in this [Ticket](https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/issues/3240#issuecomment-345991787).
